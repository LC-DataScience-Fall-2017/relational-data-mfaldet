## Chapter 13 Relational Data

For nycflights13:

`flights` connects to planes via a single variable, `tailnum`.

`flights` connects to airlines through the `carrier` variable.

`flights` connects to airports in two ways: via the `origin` and `dest` variables.

`flights` connects to weather via `origin` (the location), and `year`, `month`, `day` and `hour` (the time).


Topics, functions

keys: `primary key`, `foreign key`,
mutating joins: `left_join`, `right_join`, `inner_join`, `full_join`
`merge vs. joins`
filtering joins: `semi_join`, `anti_join`
set operations: `intersect`, `union`, `setdiff`


## 13.2.1 Exercises

1. Imagine you wanted to draw (approximately) the route each plane flies from its origin to its destination. What variables would you need? What tables would you need to combine?

  - We would need the `origin`, `dest`, and `carrier` variables in order to join on the *airplanes* and *airports* tibbles.

2. I forgot to draw the relationship between weather and airports. What is the relationship and how should it appear in the diagram?

  - you can match the variable `origin` in *weather* to `faa` in *airports*.

3. weather only contains information for the origin (NYC) airports. If it contained weather records for all airports in the USA, what additional relation would it define with flights?

  - 

4. We know that some days of the year are “special”, and fewer people than usual fly on them. How might you represent that data as a data frame? What would be the primary keys of that table? How would it connect to the existing tables?
